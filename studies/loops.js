/*

Explain while, for, and for-in loops
Be able to loop any number of times, forward counting up to some limit, backward counting down to 0
Loop over an Array, forwards and backwards
Loop over an Object



for loop: are used to loop through a block of code a number of times.
for loops have 3 parts to them a starting condition, stoping condition, and a 
incrementr or a decrementor. for loops are used to loop over arrays
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

for-in loop: are used to loop through and accesss objects properties in an object 
for (var key in object){
    statement
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
while loop: while loops loop through a block of code only one time. 
while (condition){
    //code block to executed 
}




function loopForwardOveranArray(arr){
    for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
        console.log(arr[i]);
    }
}


list = {};
function(objects){
    
}
for (var key in object){
    
}
