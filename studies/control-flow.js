/*

If statmetns: the are the 1st condition 
if (5 === 5){
    console.log("same value")
};
--------------------------
Else-if: conditions that come after the if condioin. you can have as many else-if
statements as you like.

if (5 === 7){
    console.log("same value");
}
else if (9 > 8){
    console.log("this is true");
}
in the above condition the else if statement will run because the if condition
is not valid, but 9 > 8. therefore  "this is true" will print to the console
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Else statements: you can only have one else statement in your condition. this is
the defualt condition. if none of the other conditions will run you can count 
on your else statement to perform!! Mr. Reliable lol 

if (5 === 7){
    console.log("same value");
}
else if (9 < 8){
    console.log("this is true");
} else {"since i am the default i will run"};
