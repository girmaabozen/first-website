Object
Function
undefined
null
NaN
Infinity and -Infinity (Google them if you donâ€™t know!)
What is the difference between primitive/simple and complex data types?
Primitive values are passed to a function BY COPY, complex values are BY REFERENCE. What does that mean,
and how are they different?
-------------------------------------------

Number: a number data type is well, a number lol. this basically has 
a numberical value. the number represents integers and floating point numbers.


String: string method is textual data that is wrapped in quotes.
        the 1st index of a string beings at 0.
        the length of a string is deteremined by the # of elements in it 
        
        
Boolean: Booleans represent a logical entinity. booleans data types are cool because
they are as simple as true or false!



Array: array data types are just regular objects. you can think of an array 
as an adress.
they are cool because they are the only data type that can store
all of basic data types.
array elemetns are 0 indxed 
This includes strings, booleans, number, 
array elements can be accessed by using braceket notation


Object: object data types are list that store both keys and values.


function: a block of code that is used to execute some type of task.
functions are executed when they are invoked or "called" by their name

undefined: this happenes when a variable is declared BUT not assigned a value


null: null is an object. null is an assignement value.
this data type has exactly one value and that is "null"!


Nan: stands for NOT A NUMBER
